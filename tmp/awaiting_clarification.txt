## Question 1: Performance Target for Database Query

**Context**: 
```
SC-003: User retrieval from the database based on email completes within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance target for DB query?] milliseconds for 99% of requests.
```

**What we need to know**: What is the desired performance target (in milliseconds) for retrieving user information from the database based on their email, for 99% of requests?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | 100ms  | Standard performance expectation for most web applications. Good user experience. |
| B      | 200ms  | Acceptable performance, might be noticeable under heavy load but generally fine. |
| C      | 50ms   | High-performance target, potentially requiring more optimization efforts. |
| Custom | Provide your own value (e.g., "75ms") | Allows for a specific target based on project needs. |

## Question 2: Logging Retention and Accessibility

**Context**: 
```
SC-006: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the logging retention period and accessibility for security monitoring?]
```

**What we need to know**: What is the required retention period for authentication-related logs, and who (or which systems) should have access to these logs for security monitoring?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | 30 days retention, accessible by Security Team via centralized logging system. | Common practice for auditing and incident response. |
| B      | 90 days retention, accessible by Security Team and DevOps via centralized logging system. | Increased historical data for deeper analysis, broader access for operational troubleshooting. |
| C      | 1 year retention, accessible by Security Team, DevOps, and Audit team via centralized logging system. | Compliance-driven, provides extensive historical data, involves more stakeholders. |
| Custom | Provide your own specifics (e.g., "6 months retention, accessible by Security and Compliance via ELK stack") | Allows for specific organizational policies. |
