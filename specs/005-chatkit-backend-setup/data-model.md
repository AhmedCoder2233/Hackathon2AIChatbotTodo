# Data Model for ChatKit Backend Setup

This feature focuses on the setup and configuration of an existing backend. It does not introduce any new data models or modifications to existing ones.

For the data models utilized by the ChatKit backend, please refer to the `constitution.md` file for the "Core Technology Stack" and "Data Models" sections, which outline the `Task Model`, `Conversation Model`, and `Message Model`.
