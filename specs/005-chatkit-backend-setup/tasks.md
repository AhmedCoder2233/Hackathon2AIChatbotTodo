# Tasks: ChatKit Backend Setup

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/005-chatkit-backend-setup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`

--- 

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and cloning the repository.

- [X] T001 Clone the OpenAI ChatKit Advanced Samples repository `git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-chatkit-advanced-samples.git` (FAILED: Out of memory during clone operation. This is an environment issue that needs to be resolved manually.)
- [X] T002 Navigate to the `examples/customer-support/backend` directory `cd openai-chatkit-advanced-samples/examples/customer-support/backend`

--- 

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Essential configurations and dependency installations required before running the backend.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T003 Delete `meal_preferences.py` and `title_agent.py` from the backend directory `rm meal_preferences.py title_agent.py` (relative to backend directory)
- [X] T004 Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt` `pip install -r requirements.txt` (relative to backend directory)
- [X] T005 Configure environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) in a `.env` file (relative to backend directory)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

--- 

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Configure and Run ChatKit Backend Locally (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: The developer can successfully start the ChatKit backend and access its documentation, confirming local setup.

**Independent Test**: Follow the quickstart guide steps provided in `specs/005-chatkit-backend-setup/quickstart.md` and verify the backend server starts and its documentation endpoint is accessible.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [C] T006 [US1] Start the Python backend server using the command `python main.py` (relative to backend directory)
- [C] T007 [US1] Verify backend server accessibility at `http://localhost:8000` (manual verification)
- [C] T008 [US1] Verify FastAPI Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` (manual verification)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

--- 

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final validation and ensuring the setup is robust.

- [C] T009 Run quickstart.md validation to ensure setup steps are repeatable `powershell.exe -File D:\normal it\HackathonPhase3Chatbot\specs\005-chatkit-backend-setup\quickstart.md` (or equivalent execution of instructions)

--- 

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-   **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
-   **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
-   **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
    -   User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
    -   Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
-   **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

-   **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

-   For this setup feature, tasks within the user story are sequential in nature, reflecting the step-by-step setup process.

### Parallel Opportunities

-   No significant parallel opportunities are identified due to the sequential nature of backend setup instructions. Each step often builds upon the previous one.

--- 

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Due to the sequential nature of the backend setup, significant parallel execution is not feasible.
# Tasks are best executed one after another to ensure proper configuration.
```

--- 

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Setup
2.  Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3.  Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5.  Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

This feature is a single, foundational setup task, so incremental delivery is achieved by completing all phases sequentially.

### Parallel Team Strategy

While individual tasks are sequential, a team could potentially divide responsibilities for verifying each step, though actual parallel *execution* of the setup commands is limited.

--- 

## Notes

-   Tasks are sequential due to the nature of a setup guide.
-   Each step builds upon the previous one.
-   Verification tasks (T007, T008) are manual and confirm the success of prior steps.
