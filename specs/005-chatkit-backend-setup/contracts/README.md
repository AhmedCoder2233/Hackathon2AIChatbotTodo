# API Contracts for ChatKit Backend Setup

This feature focuses on the setup and configuration of an existing backend. It does not introduce any new API contracts or modifications to existing ones.

The API contract for this backend is provided by its FastAPI Swagger documentation, which is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/docs` once the backend server is running. This documentation serves as the authoritative source for the API's endpoints, request/response schemas, and functionalities.
