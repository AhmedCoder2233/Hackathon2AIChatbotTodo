# Question 1: AI Framework Alignment

**Context**: The project constitution specifies `OpenAI Agents SDK` as the AI Framework, but the current feature request explicitly uses `Gemini API`.

**What we need to know**: Should we proceed with `Gemini API` for this feature as requested, or should we adapt the feature to use `OpenAI Agents SDK` to maintain alignment with the constitution?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | **Proceed with Gemini API**: Implement the feature using the Gemini API as requested. | This will fulfill the immediate feature request and leverage Gemini's capabilities. However, it introduces a divergence from the project constitution's specified AI framework, potentially leading to a mixed AI ecosystem. |
| B      | **Adapt to OpenAI Agents SDK**: Modify the feature to use the OpenAI Agents SDK for AI interactions. | This will maintain strict alignment with the project constitution. It may require re-evaluating the specific API capabilities needed for this feature and potentially impact development time if the integration differs significantly from Gemini. |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Please specify your preferred AI framework and provide a brief justification for your choice. |
