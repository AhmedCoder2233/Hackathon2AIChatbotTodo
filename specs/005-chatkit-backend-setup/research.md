# Research for ChatKit Backend Setup

## Resolved Clarifications

All "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers in the `plan.md` have been addressed:
-   **Testing**: Assumed `pytest` as standard for Python/FastAPI projects.

## Conclusion

Given that this feature focuses on providing explicit setup instructions for an existing backend, no further external research or complex technical investigations are required beyond the provided steps and the assumptions made. The current understanding is sufficient to proceed with design and implementation planning.
